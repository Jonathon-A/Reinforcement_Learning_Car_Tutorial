# Reinforcement Learning Car Tutorial üèéÔ∏è

This project is a hands-on tutorial for building a simple 2D car racing game in **Python** using **PyGame** and training an AI agent with **Reinforcement Learning (PPO in PyTorch)**.  
The agent learns to race around a track through trial and error, improving its lap times as training progresses.  

## Features
- Interactive 2D racing game built with PyGame  
- Reinforcement Learning agent powered by PPO (PyTorch)  
- Reward shaping for collision avoidance and lap progression  
- Visualization of training performance  
- Save and load trained models
